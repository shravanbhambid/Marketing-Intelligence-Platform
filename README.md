📊 Marketing Intelligence Platform
🚀 Project Overview

The Marketing Intelligence Platform is an AI-powered, end-to-end solution designed to help businesses make data-driven marketing and sales decisions. It integrates customer sentiment analysis, AI-driven content generation, lead scoring, and marketing campaign performance prediction into a single, unified, and user-friendly dashboard. The platform leverages the Google Gemini API for advanced NLP and reasoning, while allowing users to upload data easily in Excel or CSV formats.
